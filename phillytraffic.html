			<h2>The Interview Script</h2>
				<p>1. What do you make of (think about) this graph's design?<br>
				2. Can you explain the overall depiction of this graph?<br>
				3. Can you find any specific information in this data that is relevant to you?<br>
				4. Which day do you think has the most number of collisions?<br>
				5. Do you think that the intersections have any connection to the collisions or injuries?<br>
				6. What kind of intersection has more trouble?<br>
				7. Do you think that the cars are safe from these collisions or injuries?<br>
				8. Do you think this graph provided you with enough information?<br>
				9. What else would you like to know or see fixed?
				10. What according to you is the reason for the collisions leading to injuries?<br>
				11. How do you think people can avoid these collisions and injuries?</p>

			<h2>Findings Summary</h2>
			<div class="traffic-findings">
				<div class="finding-design">
					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>1. Colors help increase the visual aspect of differentiating data<br>
					2. Hover information is well received if the user knows what to do to get the data from certain hover points.<br>
					3. The legend of any chart or graph needs to be very easily visible for the user to interpret the data.<br>
					4. Icons and Interaction Assistance is required for the user to know what to do.<br>
					5. Colors have to be chosen according to the subject matter for convenience and quick understanding.<br>
					6. Lack of direction and differentiation in the chart or graph can confuse or mislead a reader.<br>
					7. Text in all labels should be horizontal and not vertical for user readability.<br>
					8. 50% of the users could understand the data on the chart/ graph provided.<br>
					9. 20% of the users did not know how to interpret the data.<br>
					10. The parameters have to be accurate and also labelled in a way that the user can extrapolate data in an easy manner.<br>
					11. All measurements need to have a unit of measurement without which the data cannot be quantified in any way possible.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="finding-crash">
					<h3>Crash</h3>
					<p>1. People crash because they drive fast, don't pay attention to the road or don't obey the rules of the road.<br>
					2. Cars also have a lot of accidents, and conventional signals sign have the most intersection troubles.<br>
					3. People should pay more attention to the surrounding especially the signal, slow down and follow the road rules when they are walking or driving.<br>
					4. Should have the data of car accidents and make comparisons of all of them.<br>
					5. Should explain what specific intersection it is.<br>
					6. People focus more on specific transportation they use the most.</p>

		<div class="traffic-validation">
			<h2>Validation Research</h2>
			<h3>I took the wireframe and visual design to 8 users, these are the top five findings in the interview.</h3>
			<p>1. Need to provide the data of more transportations, just pedestrian, motor and bicycle can't represent the overall situation. The injuries of car is a very important data.   <br>
			2. Don't show too much data at the same time on the page. Hover to show more data is better. But it should be a guide to tell users that hover can get more informations. <br>
			3. Should consist the style of same type of data. These three lines should focus on the same style guide.<br>
			4. The colors of the transportation and intersections can't be the same. Users are confused about what the color means in different area.<br>
			5. Focus on the color and the font size to make the chart more readable. Red font on the dark background is hard to read.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="traffic-next">
			<h2>Next Step</h2>
			<p>1. Improve the wireframe, try to add more trip mode.<br>
			2. Amplify the chart size, increase the font size, to make people can see it clearly.<br>
			3. Improve the chart library ,and add some icon to explain what the intersection it is on the chart.<br>
			4. Add interaction of the visual design image.<br>
			5. Have some sentence or pattern to tell users how to interact with data.</p>
